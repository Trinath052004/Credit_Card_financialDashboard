📊 Credit Card Transaction & Customer Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes credit card transaction data to gain insights into revenue, customer behavior, spending patterns, and demographics. Using interactive dashboards, we explore how different factors (card type, transaction mode, education, occupation, age, income group, etc.) impact overall credit card performance.

The project consists of two key dashboards:

Credit Card Transaction Report – Focused on transactions, revenue sources, and card categories.

Credit Card Customer Report – Focused on customer demographics, income, and behavioral segmentation.
