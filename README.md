📊 Credit Card Transaction & Customer Analysis
📌 Project Overview

Credit card usage is one of the most important indicators of consumer spending behavior.
This project explores credit card transaction data to understand:

- How revenue is generated

- Which customer groups contribute the most

- Spending patterns across categories, demographics, and geographies

- Growth opportunities for the bank/issuer

- Two interactive Power BI dashboards were built for analysis:

- Credit Card Transaction Report → Focused on transactions, card categories, and usage behavior

- Credit Card Customer Report → Focused on customer demographics, income levels, and lifestyle patterns

- The goal is to provide business insights that can guide marketing campaigns, credit policies, and customer engagement strategies.
